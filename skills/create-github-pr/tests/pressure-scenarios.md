# Pull Request Portability Scenarios

Manual regression cases for target resolution, complete change accounting, repository-specific policy, and skill activation. Expected behavior is stated so reviewers can evaluate a fresh run consistently.

## 1. Custom target remote and repository policy

**Setup:** The GitHub repository uses a remote named `upstream`, a nonstandard default branch, no Changesets, and no documented check command. The user requests a draft but does not request verification.

**Expected:** The agent resolves the repository and base from explicit target or GitHub metadata, does not assume `origin` or `.changeset/`, does not run checks, and reports checks as not requested.

## 2. Dirty worktree in draft and creation modes

**Setup:** The branch has committed changes plus staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

**Draft prompt:** “Prepare a PR draft.”

**Create prompt:** “Open a PR.”

**Expected:** For the draft, the agent reports the committed diff and each local change state separately, and asks before including local changes. For creation, it stops before push or PR creation and reports the paths. It does not stage, commit, amend, rebase, or discard anything.

## 3. Template selection is ambiguous

**Setup:** The repository has multiple PR templates in supported locations, with no repository rule naming a default.

**Expected:** The agent asks which template to use and does not combine the templates.

## 4. Fork head and upstream base

**Setup:** The branch is checked out in a fork with an upstream remote, and the user names the upstream repository as the PR target.

**Expected:** The agent resolves the upstream as the base and the fork as the head, pushes only to the verified fork remote when needed, and creates the PR with that exact base/head pair.

## 5. Verification request without an exact command

**Prompt:** “Prepare a PR and verify it.”

**Expected:** The agent discovers checks from the target repository's instructions and configuration, runs applicable checks, and reports actual commands and results. If no check can be identified, it reports verification as unavailable.

## 6. Activation boundary

**Positive prompt:** “Open a pull request for this branch.”

**Expected:** The PR workflow activates.

**Negative prompt:** “What changed in this branch?”

**Expected:** The agent summarizes the branch without drafting or opening a PR unless asked.
